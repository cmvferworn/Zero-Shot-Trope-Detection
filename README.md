# Zero-Shot-Trope-Detection

Master Thesis Work: Zero-Shot Trope Detection as Information Extraction and Textual Entailment, 2023
Cassandra Ferworn

This is a joint investigation intp zero-shot learning and text-based trope detection is jointly investigated.

Building on previous work, the existing [Tropes in Movies Synopses (TiMoS) dataset](https://github.com/htsucml/TiMoS) (Chang et al., 2021), containing film synopses from IMDB  and Wikipedia  annotated with tropes from TVTropes , is extended with transformed trope definitions added as queries and hypotheses. The trope detection task is then reformatted three separate ways. Following the example of previous zero-shot work, it is approached as: 
1.	a textual entailment task, 
2.	a question answering task, and as 
3.	a combined question answering to entailment pipeline.
